# Connect 4 board game solved using Artificial Intelligence 
Solving connect 4 board game using using alpha beta pruning search algorithm evaluated by minimax algorithm. This repository should also help you to understand the minimax algorithm with optimized search strategy alpha beta pruning. We implement the algorithm using python2 and tested on linux platform.

## How to run
- **Linux/Windows/MacOS** :On linux platform, clone this repository and open terminal. change directory with command `cd` to clone repository. Then run command `python Connect4_Game.py`
- You can use default board grids or input your configuration.
- Game is started between bot and user with first move taken by the bot.
- Next, enter the number where you would like to place your `0` (Bot uses `x` sign).

## Requirements
